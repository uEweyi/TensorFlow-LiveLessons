# TensorFlow-LiveLessons
This repository is home to the code that accompanies the *Deep Learning with TensorFlow* LiveLessons that will become available within the O'Reilly Safari environment in Summer 2017. 

Step-by-step guides for running the code in this repository can be found in the [installation directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons/tree/master/installation). 

All of the code that I cover in the LiveLessons can be found in [this directory]((https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons/tree/master/notebooks) as Jupyter notebooks. 

Below is the sequence in which I covered them:
