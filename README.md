# TensorFlow-LiveLessons
This repository is home to the code that accompanies the *Deep Learning with TensorFlow* LiveLessons that will become available within the O'Reilly Safari environment in Summer 2017. 

## Installation

Step-by-step guides for running the code in this repository can be found in the [installation directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons/tree/master/installation). 

## Notebooks

All of the code that I cover in the LiveLessons can be found in [this directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons/tree/master/notebooks) as Jupyter notebooks. 

Below is the lesson-by-lesson sequence in which I covered them: 

### Lesson One: Introduction to Deep Learning

#### 1.1 Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Via analogy to their biological inspirations, this section introduces Artificial Neural Networks and how they developed to their predominantly *deep* architectures today.

#### 1.2 Running the Code in These LiveLessons

This section covers the [installation directory](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons/tree/master/installation) introduced above,
